  <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem; color: #333; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 900px;">
    In many coastal regions of India, <strong>Primary Health Centers (PHCs)</strong> and rural clinics continue to face 
    <strong>frequent and prolonged power outages</strong>, severely impacting their ability to operate essential medical 
    equipment such as vaccine refrigerators, oxygen concentrators, and diagnostic tools. According to the 
    <strong>Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Rural Health Statistics Report 2023)</strong>, nearly 
    <strong>70% of PHCs in coastal districts</strong> experience regular electricity disruptions. These clinics often 
    depend on <strong>diesel generators</strong>, which not only increase operational costs but also contribute to 
    <strong>air pollution and carbon emissions</strong>. The lack of reliable and affordable power supply compromises 
    healthcare delivery, emergency response, and patient safety in underserved communities. This critical challenge 
    calls for a <strong>sustainable, low-maintenance, and renewable power solution</strong> capable of ensuring 
    <strong>24/7 electricity</strong> without relying on fossil fuels.

          <h3>üí° Innovative Solution</h3>
          <p>
       The proposed <b>Smart VAWT Microgrid System</b> harnesses <b>coastal wind energy</b> to provide a 
      sustainable and uninterrupted power supply for rural health clinics. The system employs a 
      <b>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)</b> designed for low-speed and variable wind conditions, converting 
      wind <b>kinetic energy</b> into <b>mechanical energy</b> and subsequently into <b>electrical energy</b> through a generator. 
      The generated DC power is stored in a <b>battery bank</b> and later converted to AC using a <b>smart inverter and controller</b> 
      to power essential medical devices such as <b>vaccine refrigerators and oxygen concentrators</b>. An integrated 
      <b>IoT monitoring system</b> enables real-time tracking of turbine performance, battery charge, and load distribution, 
      ensuring predictive maintenance and high operational efficiency. This innovative setup significantly 
      <b>reduces diesel dependency, operational costs, and carbon emissions</b>, providing a reliable and eco-friendly 
      energy source for healthcare facilities in coastal regions.

<h3>‚öôÔ∏è Explanation</h3>
<p>
  <b>Source of Energy:</b> The proposed system utilizes <b>coastal wind energy</b> as a clean, renewable source. 
  Coastal regions in India experience consistent wind speeds throughout the year, making them ideal for 
  decentralized microgrid systems powering rural health centers. The vertical-axis design enables efficient 
  operation even in turbulent or low-speed winds.<br><br>

  <b>Conversion Process:</b> The <b>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)</b> captures wind‚Äôs kinetic energy and converts 
  it into mechanical rotation. This motion drives a <b>generator</b> that produces <b>direct current (DC)</b> electricity. 
  The generated DC power is stored in <b>battery units</b> for stable energy supply and then converted into 
  <b>alternating current (AC)</b> through a <b>smart inverter</b> for distribution to clinic loads. 
  An integrated <b>IoT monitoring system</b> tracks turbine speed, battery charge, and power output in real time.<br><br>

  <b>Output / Utilization:</b> The system ensures <b>uninterrupted electricity</b> for essential medical equipment such as 
  <b>refrigerators, oxygen concentrators, and lighting systems</b>. By reducing reliance on diesel generators, it cuts 
  operational costs and emissions.<br><br>

  <b>Real-world Relevance:</b> This project aligns with India‚Äôs <b>MNRE Smart Grid Mission</b> and supports 
  <b>Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy)</b>. 
  It provides 24√ó7 power to rural health facilities, enabling life-saving operations and promoting a cleaner, 
  self-sustaining energy future for underserved coastal communities.
